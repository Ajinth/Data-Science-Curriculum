    "- The main steps of a KNN algorithm are:\n",
    "    1. Choose the number k and the distance metric.\n",
    "        - choosing the correct number k could mean the difference between overfitting and underfitting.\n",

    "    3. Assign the class label by majority vote.\n",
    "        - in the case of a tie, we assign the class whose neighbors are the closest. If the different neighbors are equidistant from the sample, the algorithm will choose the class that comes first in the training dataset."
