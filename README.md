# Data-Science-Curriculum

This repo is my personal compendium of essential data science concepts and techniques. The primary objective is to have enough standalone content in one place that will allow me or to obtain the necessary knowledge to be a data scientist.  

Note: some of the content for these modules was directly copied from other sources. Please consult the reference section of each module for those sources.
