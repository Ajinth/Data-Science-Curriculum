    "Classical Probability: Classical probability is the proportion of times that an event will occur, assuming that all outcomes in a sample space are equally likely to occur. Dividing the number of outcomes in the sample space that satisfy the event by the total number of outcomes in the sample space determines the probability of an event. The probability of an event A is P(A) = f/N, where f is the number of outcomes that satisfy the condition of event A and N is the total number of outcomes in the sample space. The important idea here is that one can develop a probability from fundamental reasoning about the process.  "
