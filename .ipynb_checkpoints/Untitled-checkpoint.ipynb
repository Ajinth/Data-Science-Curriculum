    "- `git config -global user.name \"zlatankr\"`: set the user name\n",
    "- `git config -global user.email \"zlatankr@gmail.com\"`: set the email\n",
    "- `git config --list`: view all the current settings\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a repo:\n",
    "- `git clone [paste the repo URL]`: clones repo into current directory\n",
    "    - _Note:_ you still have to enter into this directory once you've created it \n",
    "\n",
    "...or you can link your working directory to an online repo with:\n",
    "- `git init`\n",
    "- `git remote add origin [paste repo URL]`\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what the origin is linked to:\n",
    "- `git remote -v`\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove the existing remote repository link:\n",
    "- `git remote rm origin`\n",

    "\n",
    "Before beginning work, make sure your local directory is synced with the master branch in your remote repo:\n",
    "- `git pull origin master`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get this error, \"your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge,\" then try:\n",
    "- `git checkout HEAD^ [file to overwrite]`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get this error, \"the following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge,\" then try:\n",
    "- `git add *`: this is the same as `git add .`, except it excludes file names that start with a dot\n",
    "- `git stash`: use when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.\n",
    "- `git pull`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are ready to add files to source control:\n",
    "- `git add .`: adds everything in the directory to source control\n",
    "- `git add -u`: adds only the files that are already tracked\n",
    "- `git add -A`: only takes into account any deletions\n",
    "\n",
    "To commit these changes into the log:\n",
    "- `git commit -m \"[message]\"`: make sure you write the change summary in the message\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git status`: inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area\n",
    "- `git diff`: shows the difference between the wroking directory and the staging area\n",
    "- `git log`: shows a list of all the previous commits\n",
    "\n",
    "...or you can break the process into a fetch followed by a merge:\n",
    "- `git fetch`: fetches work from the remote into the local copy\n",
    "- `git merge origin/master': merges origin/master into your local branch\n",
    "\n",
    "To push all your commits to the remote directory:\n",
    "- `git push origin master`\n",
