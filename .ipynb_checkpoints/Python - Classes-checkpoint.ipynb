    "When we say that one variable equals another, e.g. `variable2 = variable1`, the variable on the left-hand side of the equal-sign takes on the value of the variable on the right. With class instances, this happens a little differently - the name on the left becomes the class instance on the right. So in `instance2 = instance1`, `instance2` is 'pointing' to `instance1` - there are two names given to the one class instance, and you can access the class instance via either name.\n",
