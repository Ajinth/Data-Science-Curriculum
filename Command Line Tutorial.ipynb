    "The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with theroot directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`pwd`** - outputs the name of the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`ls`** - lists all files and directories in the working directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`cd`** - switches you into the directory you specify.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`cd -`** - switches you to your previous directory.    \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`cd ..`** - takes you to the parent folder of the current directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`mkdir`** - creates a new directory in the working directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`mkdir -p`** - creates multiple directories AND subdirectories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  **`mkdir - Test/Subtest Test2/Subtest2`**  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`touch`** - creates a new file inside the working directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Options modify the behavior of commands:\n",
    ">\t**`ls -a`** - lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`ls -l`** - lists all contents in long format  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`ls -t`** - orders files and directories by the time they were last modified  \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple options can be used together, like **`ls -alt`**\n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**Ctrl + U**: Clears the line from the cursor point back to the beginning.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**Ctrl + A**: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**Ctrl + E**: Moves the cursor to the end of the line.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**Ctrl + R**: Allows you to search through the previous commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**Ctrl + Z**: Sends current process to background and you get back to the shell prompt.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**Ctrl + C**: Kills the current process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`cp`** - copies files  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`mv`** - moves and renames files  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`rm`** - removes files  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`rm -r`** - removes directories (r is for recursive)  \n",
    "\n",
    ">   **`rm â€“rf`** - force deletes all files and subdirectories (f is for force).  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`cat`** - displays the file contents directly on the screen  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`history`** - returns the log of all the commands you've executed  \n",
    "\n",
    "Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error. The common redirection commands are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`>`** - redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: **`ls -l > RECORD.txt`**\n",

    ">\t**`>>`** - redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`<`** - redirects standard input to a command.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`|`** - redirects standard output of a command to another command. Useful for chaining commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example **`cat *.txt | sort | uniq > result-file`**  \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands.   \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`sort`** - sorts lines of text alphabetically in a givne file.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`uniq`** - filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">   **`find`** - searches for files (accepts regular expressions). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example **`find *.txt`**  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`grep`** - searches for a text pattern and outputs it (accepts regular expressions).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: to search for the word philosophy in all current files: **`grep \"philosophy`**  \n",
    "Example: to search for the word philosophy, case insensitive in all current files: **`grep -i \"philosophy`**  \n",
    "Example: to search for the word philosophy, case insensitive in all current files and subdirectories: **`grep -ir \"philosophy`**\n",
    "\n",
    ">\tThe **`-i`** option causes a case-insensitive search.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\tThe **`-w`** option matches only whole words.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\tThe **`-l`** option lists only the files in which matches were found, but not the matching lines.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\tThe **`-r`** (recursive) option searches files in the current working directory and all subdirectories below it.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\tThe **`-n`** option lists the matching lines, together with line numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\tThe **`-v`** (or --invert-match) option filters out matches.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\tThe **`-z`** seems to return a portion of the text that contains the match.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">\t**`sed`** - searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it. "
